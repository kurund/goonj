## Version 2.9 uses the token processor

## Version 2.5 and the removal of the token processor

In Version 2.5 the token processor is removed. There have been too many issues with tokens for too long. 
The main issue for removing token processor is that the hook_civicrm_tokenValues did not work any more in CiviCRM 5.42 and email api 2.4.

It now uses the same code for token replacements as the action provider extension.

## Version 2.0 and the token processor
Version 2.0 adds support for the new CiviCRM token processor introduced via https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14662.

**It may not be fully backwards compatible with older versions so you should check before upgrading**

But it adds support for processing activity tokens which is nice.

## Description

Email API for CiviCRM to send emails through the API

The entity for the Email API is Email and the action is Send.

Parameters for the api are specified below:
- `contact_id`: list of contacts IDs to create the PDF Letter (separated by ",")
- `template_id`: ID of the message template which will be used in the API.
- `from_name`: **optional** name of the sender (if you provide this value you have also to provide from_email)
- `from_email`: **optional** email of the sender (if you provide this value you have also to provide from_name)
- `alternative_receiver_address`: **optional** alternative receiver address of the email.
- `case_id`: **optional** adds the email to the case identified by this ID.
- `create_activity`: **optional** (default: 1) Record a copy of the email sent in an activity
- `activity_details`: **optional** (default: html,text) what to include in
  the details field of the created activity: HTML/Text/both versions, or
  just the name of the message template (it may be a disk space issue
  storing a full copy of everything on a busy site).
- `from_email_option`: **optional** option value of email addresses configured in Communications >> From Email Addresses

*It is not possible to specify your own message through the API.*


## Differences with CiviCRM core `MessageTemplate.send` API

For historical reasons
[[1](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/emailapi/-/issues/12)]
[[2](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/emailapi/-/issues/13)]
we have two similar APIs, here's a list of differences so you can choose one
that's suitable for your needs, and migrate between them should you need to.

- **Message template**: `Email.send` uses `template_id`; `MessageTemplate.send` uses `id`.

- **To**: Both APIs default to details from the Contact record. `Email.send` uses `alternative_receiver_address` to allow override of the address, in which case no friendly name will be used in the To address. `MessageTemplate.send` uses `to_email` and `to_name`.

- **From**: `Email.send` uses separate `from_name` and `from_email` parameters which use system defaults if not supplied; `MessageTemplate.send` uses the combined `"Friendly Name" <email@example.org>` form in `from`.

- **Subject**: Both system take this from the Message Template, however
  `Email.send` also provides a parameter override for this (since !28)

- **Text, HTML**: Both system take these from the Message Template.

- `Email.send` can use more tokens (since v2.0), e.g. activity, case, contribution.

- `Email.send` creates an activity (using core’s Email activity type).
  This behaviour can be prevented by using the `create_activity` parameter
  (since !22) (and also see `activity_details`). `MessageTemplate.send` cannot
  do this.

- `Email.send` provides an Action to be used with the [Action Provider extension](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/action-provider) (separate to, but used with [Form Processor](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/form-processor/))

- `Email.send` does not support attachments; `MessageTemplate.send` does.

- `Email.send` does not support passing of template params; `MessageTemplate.send` does.

- `Email.send` does not call `hook_civicrm_alterMailParams`; `MessageTemplate.send` does.
